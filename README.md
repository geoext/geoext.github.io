# geoext.github.io

This repository contains a copy of the gh-pages of https://github.com/geoext/geoext in an alternative folder `geoext3` to keep old API links working.

The only difference is `geoext3/index.html` which contains a redirect to `https://geoext.github.io/geoext`.

The folder `geoext3/master` is automatically updated via github actions on push from the geoext repository and the `geoext3/<tag>` folders are created the same way on tagging.

All other files are currently the same as in this commit: https://github.com/geoext/geoext/tree/245aac0d677f29c2b8414e0e76e9425439fe1e28
